### Reasons to use a text editor?
- They are (if not extremely customized) much more simplistic than IDEs which makes them faster. If an IDE is not absolutely necessary or much more convenient for the task performed a text editor is a faster alternative.
- Example: Reading code does not require a build in debugger.

### General Pattern

- Prompt - generated by the program to provide context for the client
- Command - provided by the client
- param1 … paramM - optional parameters provided by the client. The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued
